# Generative AI-based Application for Students

This repository contains the initial phase of my project, where I aim to create a generative AI-based app with a conversational 
interface to assist students in career counseling and the job application process, particularly those majoring in programming. 
The app will access the user's GitHub account to evaluate their coding abilities. Based on a desired job description and 
the user's resume as input, OpenAI will provide advice on how to improve their skill set and resume for job applications.

In this first step, I use FastAPI to connect Chainlit in the frontend and OpenAI in the backend, instructing the AI to access
all repositories in the user's GitHub account.
